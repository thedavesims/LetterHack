#LetterHack

##A stupid simple Letterpress word finder

Prints out the 5 longest words that are possible given the letters that appear in the Letterpress grid and words that appear in the wordlist.
Makes use of the public domain ENABLE word list. Letterpress may use a different word list. I don't know.
