#LetterHack

##A stupid simple Letterpress word finder

Prints out the 5 longest words that are possible given the letters that appear in the Letterpress grid and words that appear in the wordlist.

If called with an argument, it uses just those letters to compare. Then the words that are supersets of those letters are included. This is useful for game-enders.

Makes use of the public domain ENABLE word list. Letterpress may use a different word list.
